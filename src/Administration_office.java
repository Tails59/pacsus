/**
 * This class represents the interactive interface to PACSUS administration functions carried
 * out in the Estates and Campus Services Office.  Information about these functions is in the
 * Administration use case diagram (hyperlinked from this class).
 *
 * The interface comprises one screen with all the functions present on it: they could all be on
 * view at once, or perhaps in alternative JPanels (in a JFrame with JTabbedPane); the current
 * date (day number) is always displayed.
 *
 * There could be any number of instances of this class, potentially one for each workstation
 * in the office, with different staff carrying different functions.
 *
 * The class implements Observer, and observes the system status so that it can keep the displayed current date correct.
