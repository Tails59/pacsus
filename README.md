CSCU9P6 Object Oriented Implementation Group Project   Spring 2021

This project is based on the University's car parking arrangements around year 2000:
The University's road entrances were protected by automatic barriers. There were 
number plate reading cameras at each entrance. Drivers had to buy permits for
their car(s). The camera/barrier system would only allow a vehicle onto the campus
if the number plate was associated with a valid permit in the central computer system.
The document CarEntryAndParkingRegulations.pdf contains the guidance and regulations 
applying to vehicular campus access at that time.
